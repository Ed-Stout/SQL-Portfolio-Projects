# SQL-Portfolio-Projects

Space for projects I have worked on which demonstrate my SQL skills.

Links to the original datasets should be available in the first line of the text files.

There are four projects from four seperate datasets which aim to demonstrate that I am able to do all of the following:
1. World Population dataset - simple numerical functions and queries: SELECT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIKE
2. IMDb dataset (Movies) - simple database management queries: ALTER TABLE, HAVING, CASE, AS
3. Football Players dataset - More complex queries involving multiple tables: CROSS, LEFT, INNER, OUTER JOINS & UNION
4. Churn rate project - complex query to ask difficult aggregate questions of a large dataset: CASE, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
